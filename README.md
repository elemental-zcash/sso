# sso
Elemental Zcash SSO OAuth2 server

## Getting Started

```sh
git clone #...
```

### Requirements

- Docker (Docker Desktop or Docker Engine)
- mkcert (for local development, or can disable nginx HTTPS in docker-compose)
  - Please be aware of the security risks of using custom root CAs. They should never leave, or be used outside of a dev machine.
  - `brew install mkcert`
  - `mkcert -install`


###Â Local HTTPS Setup

```sh
HOST=elemental-sso.local
mkdir certs
mkcert -cert-file certs/$HOST.crt -key-file certs/$HOST.key $HOST
```

### Running the Servers

```sh
npm run start:local # alias for the docker-compose script
```
